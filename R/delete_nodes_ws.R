#' Delete all nodes in a node selection
#'
#' @description
#'
#' In a graph object of class `dgr_graph`, delete all nodes present in a
#' selection of nodes.
#'
#' This function makes use of an active selection of nodes (and the function
#' ending with `_ws` hints at this).
#'
#' Selections of nodes can be performed using the following node selection
#' (`select_*()`) functions: [select_nodes()], [select_last_nodes_created()],
#' [select_nodes_by_degree()], [select_nodes_by_id()], or
#' [select_nodes_in_neighborhood()].
#'
#' Selections of nodes can also be performed using the following traversal
#' (`trav_*()`) functions: [trav_out()], [trav_in()], [trav_both()],
#' [trav_out_node()], [trav_in_node()], [trav_out_until()], or
#' [trav_in_until()].
#'
#' @inheritParams render_graph
#'
#' @return A graph object of class `dgr_graph`.
