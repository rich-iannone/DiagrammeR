#' Get histogram data for a graph's degree frequency
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Get histogram data for a graph's degree frequency. The bin width is set to 1
#' and zero-value degrees are omitted from the output.
#'
#' @inheritParams render_graph
#' @param mode using `total` (the default), degree considered for each node
#'   will be the total degree. With `in` and `out` the degree used
#'   will be the in-degree and out-degree, respectively.
#'
#' @return A data frame with degree counts.
