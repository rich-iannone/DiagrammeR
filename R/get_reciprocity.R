#' Get the graph reciprocity

#' @description
#'
#' Get the reciprocity of a directed graph. The reciprocity of a graph is the
#' fraction of reciprocal edges (e.g., `1` -> `2` and `2` -> `1`) over all edges
#' available in the graph. Note that for an undirected graph, all edges are
#' reciprocal. This function does not consider loop edges (e.g., `1` -> `1`).
#'
#' @inheritParams render_graph
#'
#' @return A single, numerical value that is the ratio value of reciprocal edges
#'   over all graph edges.
#'
#' @examples
#' # Define a graph where 2 edge definitions
#' # have pairs of reciprocal edges
#' graph <-
#'   create_graph() %>%
#'   add_cycle(n = 3) %>%
#'   add_node(
#'     from = 1,
#'       to = 1) %>%
#'   add_node(
#'     from = 1,
#'       to = 1)

#' # Get the graph reciprocity, which will
#' # be calculated as the ratio 4/7 (where
#' # 4 is the number reciprocating edges
#' # and 7 is the total number of edges
#' # in the graph)
#' graph %>%
#'   get_reciprocity()
#'
#' # For an undirected graph, all edges
#' # are reciprocal, so the ratio will
#' # always be 1
#' graph %>%
#'   set_graph_undirected() %>%
#'   get_reciprocity()

#' # For a graph with no edges, the graph
#' # reciprocity cannot be determined (and
#' # the same NA result is obtained from an
#' # empty graph)
