#' Delete a node from an existing graph object
#'
#' @description
#'
#' From a graph object of class `dgr_graph`, delete an existing node by
#' specifying its node ID.
#'
#' @inheritParams render_graph
#' @param node A node ID for the node to be deleted from the graph.
#'
#' @return A graph object of class `dgr_graph`.
#'
#' @examples
#' # Create a graph with 5 nodes and
#' # edges between each in a path
#' graph <-
#'   create_graph() %>%
#'   add_path(n = 5)
#'
#' # Delete node with ID `3`
#' graph <- delete_node(graph, node = 3)
#'
#' # Verify that the node with ID `3`
#' # is no longer in the graph
#' graph %>% get_node_ids()
#'
#' # Also note that edges are removed
#' # since there were edges between the
#' # removed node to and from other nodes
