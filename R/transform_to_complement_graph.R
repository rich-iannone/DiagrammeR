#' Create a complement of a graph
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Create a complement graph which contains only edges not present in the input
#' graph. It's important to nodes that any edge attributes in the input graph's
#' edges will be lost. Node attributes will be retained, since they are not
#' affected by this transformation.
#'
#' @inheritParams render_graph
#' @param loops An option for whether loops should be generated in the
#'   complement graph.
#'
#' @return a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.
