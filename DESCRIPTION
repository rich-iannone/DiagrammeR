Description: With the DiagrammeR package, you can create diagrams and flowcharts using R.
    Markdown-like text is used to describe a diagram and, by doing this in R, we can also
    add some R code into the mix and integrate these diagrams in the R console, through R
    Markdown, and in shiny apps.
