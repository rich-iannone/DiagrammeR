\title{Fully connect all nodes in a selection of nodes}
\usage{
fully_connect_nodes_ws(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph}.}
}
\value{
a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph}.
}
\description{
With a selection of nodes in a
graph, add any remaining edges required to
fully connect this group of edges to each
other.
}
\examples{
# Create an empty graph and
# then add a path of 3 nodes
# and two isolated nodes
graph <-
  create_graph() \%>\%
  add_path(n = 3) \%>\%
  add_n_nodes(n = 2)

# Select a node in the path
# of nodes (node `3`) and
# the two isolated nodes (`4`
# and `5`); then, and fully
# connect these nodes together
graph <-

  fully_connect_nodes_ws()

# Get the graph's edge data frame
