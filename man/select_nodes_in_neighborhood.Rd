\title{Select nodes based on a walk distance from a
specified node}
\usage{
select_nodes_in_neighborhood(graph, node, distance, set_op = "union")
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph} that is created using
\code{create_graph}.}

\item{node}{the node from which the traversal
will originate.}

\item{distance}{the maximum number of steps from
the \code{node} for inclusion in the selection.}

\item{set_op}{the set operation to perform upon
consecutive selections of graph nodes. This can
either be as a \code{union} (the default), as an
intersection of selections with \code{intersect},
or, as a \code{difference} on the previous
selection, if it exists.}
}
\value{
a graph object of class \code{dgr_graph}.
}
\description{
Select those nodes in the neighborhood
of nodes connected a specified distance from an
initial node.
}

# Create a graph containing 10 nodes,
# numbered `1` through `10`, and 4 different node
# types (`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`)
