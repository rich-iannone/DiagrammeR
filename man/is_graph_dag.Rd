\title{Is the graph a directed acyclic graph?}
\usage{
is_graph_dag(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph}.}
}
\value{
a logical value.
}
\description{
Provides a logical value on whether
the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The
conditions for a graph that is a DAG are that it
should be a directed graph and it should not
contain any cycles.
}
\examples{
# Create a directed graph containing
# only a balanced tree
graph_tree <-
  create_graph() \%>\%
  add_balanced_tree(
    k = 2, h = 3)

# Determine whether this graph
# is a DAG
is_graph_dag(graph_tree)
#> [1] TRUE

# Create a directed graph containing
# a single cycle
graph_cycle <-
  create_graph() \%>\%
  add_cycle(n = 5)

# Determine whether this graph
# is a DAG
is_graph_dag(graph_cycle)
#> [1] FALSE
