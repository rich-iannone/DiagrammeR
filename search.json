Get average age contributors. Select nodes type person (project). node type non-NA age attribute, , get attribute vector get_node_attrs_ws() calculate mean R’s mean() function. can get total number commits projects. know edges contain numerical commits attribute, , select edges (select_edges() selects edges graph). , get numeric vector commits values get sum() (commits projects). Single one known Josh get total number commits maintainer contributor. Start selecting Josh node select_nodes(conditions = name == \"Josh\"). graph, know people edge project edge can relationship (rel) type contributor maintainer. can migrate selection nodes outbound edges trav_out_edges() (won’t provide condition, just outgoing edges Josh selected). Now selection 2 edges. Get vector commits values get_edge_attrs_ws() calculate sum(). total number commits. Get total number commits Louisa, just maintainer role though. case ’ll supply condition trav_out_edge(). acts filter traversal means selection applied edges condition met. Although single value, ’ll still use sum() get_edge_attrs_ws() (good practice may know vector length, especially big graphs). something complex, like, get names people graph age 32? First, select person nodes select_nodes(conditions = type == \"person\"). , follow another select_nodes() call specifying age > 32. Importantly, set_op = \"intersect\" (giving us intersection selections). Now starting selection nodes want, need get values nodes’ name attribute character vector. get_node_attrs_ws() function. getting vector, sort names alphabetically R function sort(). get named vector, can use unname() show us names vector component. supercalc project progressing quite nicely. Let’s get total number commits people interesting project. Start selecting project’s node work backwards. Traverse edges leading trav_in_edge(). edges committers contain commits attribute numerical values. Get vector commits get sum (1676 commits). Kim now contributor stringbuildeR project made 15 new commits project. can modify graph reflect . First, add edge add_edge(). Note add_edge() usually relies node IDs creating new edge. almost always inconvenient can instead use node labels (know unique graph) compose edge, setting use_labels = TRUE. rel value add_edge() set contributor – property graph always values set node type edge rel attributes. set another attribute edge (commits) first selecting edge (last edge made, can use select_last_edges_created()), , use set_edge_attrs_ws() provide attribute/value pair. Finally, clear active selections clear_selection(). graph now changed, look.  Get email addresses contributors (maintainers) randomizer supercalc88 projects. trav_in_edge() just want contributer edges/commits. edges, hop back unconditionally people edges originate trav_out_node(). Get email values selected individuals sorted character vector. people committed one project? matter node degree. know people edges outward projects edges inward. Thus, anybody outdegree (number edges outward) greater 1 committed one project. Globally, select nodes condition using select_nodes_by_degree(\"outdeg > 1\"). getting name attribute values node selection, can provide sorted character vector names.","code":"# Load in a the small repository graph graph <-   open_graph(     system.file(       \"extdata/example_graphs_dgr/repository.dgr\",       package = \"DiagrammeR\"     )   ) render_graph(graph, layout = \"kk\") graph %>%    select_nodes(conditions = type == \"person\") %>%   get_node_attrs_ws(node_attr = age) %>%   mean() #> [1] 33.6 graph %>%    select_edges() %>%   get_edge_attrs_ws(edge_attr = commits) %>%   sum() #> [1] 5182 graph %>%    select_nodes(conditions = name == \"Josh\") %>%   trav_out_edge() %>%   get_edge_attrs_ws(edge_attr = commits) %>%   sum() #> [1] 227 graph %>%    select_nodes(conditions = name == \"Louisa\") %>%   trav_out_edge(conditions = rel == \"maintainer\") %>%   get_edge_attrs_ws(edge_attr = commits) %>%   sum() #> [1] 236 graph %>%    select_nodes(conditions = type == \"person\") %>%   select_nodes(conditions = age > 32, set_op = \"intersect\") %>%   get_node_attrs_ws(node_attr = name) %>%   sort() %>%   unname() #> [1] \"Jack\"   \"Jon\"    \"Kim\"    \"Roger\"  \"Sheryl\" graph %>%    select_nodes(conditions = project == \"supercalc\") %>%   trav_in_edge() %>%   get_edge_attrs_ws(edge_attr = commits) %>%   sum() #> [1] 1676 graph <-    graph %>%   add_edge(     from = \"Kim\",     to = \"stringbuildeR\",     rel = \"contributor\"   ) %>%   select_last_edges_created() %>%   set_edge_attrs_ws(edge_attr = commits, value = 15) %>%   clear_selection() render_graph(graph, layout = \"kk\") graph %>%    select_nodes(     conditions =        project == \"randomizer\" |        project == \"supercalc\"   ) %>%   trav_in_edge(conditions = rel == \"contributor\") %>%   trav_out_node() %>%   get_node_attrs_ws(node_attr = email) %>%   sort() %>%   unname() #> [1] \"j_2000@ultramail.io\"      \"josh_ch@megamail.kn\"      #> [3] \"kim_3251323@ohhh.ai\"      \"lhe99@mailing-fun.com\"    #> [5] \"roger_that@whalemail.net\" \"the_simone@a-q-w-o.net\"   #> [7] \"the_will@graphymail.com\" graph %>%   select_nodes_by_degree(expressions = \"outdeg > 1\") %>%   get_node_attrs_ws(node_attr = name) %>%   sort() %>%   unname() #> [1] \"Josh\"   \"Kim\"    \"Louisa\""},{"path":"/index.html","id":"installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Installation","title":"Graph/Network Visualization","text":"DiagrammeR used R environment. don’t R installation, can obtained Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). can install development version DiagrammeR GitHub using devtools package. , get CRAN. encounter bug, usage questions, want share ideas make package better, feel free file issue.","code":"devtools::install_github(\"rich-iannone/DiagrammeR\") install.packages(\"DiagrammeR\")"},{"path":"/index.html","id":"code-of-conduct","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Code of Conduct","title":"Graph/Network Visualization","text":"Please note DiagrammeR project released contributor code conduct.participating project agree abide terms.","code":""},{"path":"/index.html","id":"id_-license","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"📄 License","title":"Graph/Network Visualization","text":"DiagrammeR licensed MIT license.
